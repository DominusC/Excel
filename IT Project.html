    <h2> My ICT project </h2>
    <h1>I hope to build an LMS in ICT, which is a cloud classroom. Students can learn through online classrooms.
      Teachers can give lectures online and mark students' homework. They can also initiate exams and grades. Students
      can play the teacher's class indefinitely. content and study after class.</h1>
    <h1>My values and methodology for completing this IT project was to first build a web page, using markup languages
      like HTML and CSS to make the web page usable and beautiful, appealing to students and parents, and articulate the
      content. Then, the video of the teacher's class is backed up in the cloud through the cloud space for students to
      watch repeatedly. At the same time, the cloud function allows teachers to mark homework and exam papers. Live
      broadcast using CDN network, allowing students and teachers to interact online in real time. This LMS can help
      students and teachers not interrupt their learning during the epidemic, without affecting the school's teaching
      progress, allowing students to learn knowledge repeatedly, in line with the current values and value systems.</h1>
    <h1>Required hardware and software: computer, website, electronic server, cloud disk</h1>
